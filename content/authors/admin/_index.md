Alejandro Astudillo obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Electronics Engineering from Universidad del Valle, Colombia, in 2015. He stayed at the same university, in the Industrial Control Research Group, where he held a Young Researcher position, funded by the Colombian Ministry of Science. In 2017, he was hired as a research assistant, also at Universidad del Valle, until he completed his Master’s degree in Automation Engineering the same year. He joined the MECO Research Team at KU Leuven as a PhD researcher in 2018. His research interests focus on strategies for easing the implementation of real time motion planning and control of robot manipulators.
